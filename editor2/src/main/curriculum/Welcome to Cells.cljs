;; # Say Hello to Cells

;; Welcome! On this page, we are going to introduce something called a ‚Äòcell‚Äô, which will help you make code come alive.

;; What is a cell, you may ask? Well, at the most basic level, a `cell` is a thing that:

;; * has a value,
;; * can change over time,
;; * wraps a bit of code, which tells the cell what to do every time it runs.

;; ## Your First Cell ü§†

;; Consider `interval`, a special function that resets the value of a cell repeatedly, on a timer. Given `interval`, here is a 'cell' that counts upward to infinity, one second at a time:

(cell (interval 1000 inc))

;; Cells can have names, which we define using `defcell`. Let's re-make that timer cell, but this time we'll define a name for it.

(defcell counter (interval 1000 inc))

;; By giving a cell a name, we can re-use it in other cells. This gives us tremendous power. Watch:

(defcell bigger-counter (* @counter 10))

;; Do you see how `bigger-counter` is changing every second, even though it doesn't use `interval`? That's because `bigger-counter` automatically refreshes whenever `@counter` changes, multiplying that value by 10 to create its own value.

;; This kind of cell-to-cell awareness makes cells special. It means they can be formed into a giant web, each cell ready to act together with the others. Each cell in the web stays in sync with whatever other cells it is connected to.

;; You may be wondering what that **@** (the "at sign") is doing. We use the @ symbol to ‚Äòdereference‚Äô a cell, so that we can read its value. Evaluate this, wait a few seconds, then evaluate it again. (Make sure you evaluate the *whole* expression by using `Shift-Command-Enter`.)

@counter

;; Note how `@counter` doesn‚Äôt change: it is frozen in time. When you @dereference a cell, you don‚Äôt have the whole ‚Äòcell‚Äô anymore - you get a snapshot of its value, at one point in time.

;; If we wrap `@counter` in another cell, we‚Äôll see it change again:

(cell @counter)

;; Every cell in your program dutifully keeps track of which other cells it depends on, and updates when they change. Only *cells* know how to react to other cells automatically: ordinary Clojure code doesn‚Äôt update like that.

;; ## Interconnected Cells üåéÔ∏èüåçÔ∏èüåèÔ∏è

;; Let's make a more tangled web of cells, to better see this interconnectedness in action.

;; We'll start with a cell that is a random number generator:
(defcell random-number []
  (interval 200 #(rand-int 20)))

;; The `#` ("hash" or "pound sign") immediately before an open-parenthesis might be new to you. Go ahead and evaluate that subform, `#(rand-int 20)`, and you'll see it returns a function. That's all the `#` does: it's a quick way to define an anonymous function. This [shorthand](https://clojure.org/guides/weird_characters#__code_code_anonymous_function) is no different from `(fn [] ...)` except the arguments get automatic names like %1 and %2.

;; Now we have a cell that updates itself every fifth of a second (every 200 milliseconds). Let's tinker with it a bit. Those numbers go by so fast‚Äìchange the cell to slow it down. (Or, if you're a jet-pilot kind of programmer, speed it up! ‚ö°Ô∏è üòÄ)

;; That `random-number` cell is the first part of our cell chain. Next we'll create a cell that keeps track of the last 10 random numbers generated, using the `random-number` cell:
(defcell last-ten [self]
  (take 10 (cons @random-number @self)))

;; The `last-ten` cell works by building up a list one at a time with `cons`. (If you're not familiar with `cons`, take a minute using `doc` (press `Command-i`) to get to know it.) The value that `cons` adds to the list comes from looking at the *current* value of the `random-number` cell, which we get by dereferencing it.

;; (Bonus 'how it works' puzzle: what would happen if we `take` a different number from the list, or if we didn't `take 10` at all? Think about it, then experiment.)

;; Often it's easier to think about numbers if we can make them more real. Let's do that by visualizing our last ten random numbers into shapes:
(defcell squares []
  (map square @last-ten))

;; Notice how you can see each number-as-a-square move across the list as it grows old. Notice also how `squares` uses one cell, which uses another cell, and that all those dependencies are handled *automatically* by your friend the computer.

;; Play around with those squares to see how else to visualize our random numbers. Might different shapes look cool? How could you add color? What would you have to do to assign each number a color that sticks with its shape? Experiment.

;; ## Talking to Cells üì¢ üó£Ô∏è

;; We can also **interact** with cells. Just like we used cells to track time using `interval`, we can use cells to detect user activity. We do this by "listening" for specific browser "events", such as a mouse click.

;; Let's build some cells that we can make do things. How about this: one cell will act as our "light switch", controlling whether or not the other cells get "power" (which for us will be color). The other cells will check that "light switch" cell and do different things based on its value. Then we'll make our "light switch" cell *clickable* so we can interact with it.

;; (The next part relies on the `if` expression. If you're unfamiliar with `if`, `true`, and `false`‚Äìfor instance if you're a beginner reading this right after [Learn Clojure with Shapes](/intro)‚Äìthen you probably want to go read [What If?](/what-if?) before proceeding.)

;; To build our "light switch", we'll first make a cell for the switch itself. We‚Äôll call it `toggle` because it toggles back and forth between two values, `true` and `false`, for "off" and "on". It will start "off":

(defcell toggle false)

;; This `toggle` cell doesn't do much: it's just a container for `false`. But because it's a cell, we can use it for so much more than if we defined it as a plain old `true` value on its own. As a cell, when it changes it notifies other cells that depend on it.

;; Now we build an `if` expression that draws a circle if our cell is true‚Äìactually, if it‚Äôs "truthy"‚Äìand a square if it‚Äôs not. First, let's see how works **without** cells talking to each other. What we'll do is check the value of `toggle`, and draw a circle if it's positive, and a square if it's negative.
(if @toggle
  (circle 40)
  (square 80))

;; We defined `toggle` as `false`, our `if` makes a square when `toggle` is false, so we get a square. Fine enough.

;; But here‚Äôs the thing: go back and change `toggle` to `true` and re-evaluate it. Our square stays a square! Our `if` stopped paying attention to `toggle`. We want our `if` to draw a circle whenever `toggle` is `true`, but for that to happen we have to re-evaluate our `if`. (See for yourself!) Our `if` has no idea what‚Äôs going on with `toggle` because it was evaluated in the past. That‚Äôs a bummer. ‚òπÔ∏è

;; Let‚Äôs try the same thing, but now inside a cell. Remember, cells keep track of each other.
(cell (if @toggle
        (circle 40)
        (square 80)))

;; Whatever `toggle` is right now, we should get the right shape. Here‚Äôs the difference: go and change `toggle` again. Our shape changes in the *other* cell! ü§ó üòé This is powerful. All we need to do now is add some interaction with the user‚Äìthat‚Äôs you! This requires three new ideas at once: event listeners, [keywords](https://clojure.org/reference/data_structures#Keywords), and swapping values. These three are all super helpful tools, and we‚Äôll explain each one in turn, so get ready.

;; The way we detect mouse clicks and other users actions in a browser like Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer, or Chrome is to listen for them as [events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events). We have a ready-made function to do that called `listen`:

(doc listen)

;; The documentation for `listen` tells us it takes three arguments: the `event` to listen for, a `listener` function that gets called when the event is "heard", and a `shape` to draw. (The second argument list vector in its documentation tells us that we could also call it so that it listens for more than one event.)

;; The first argument to `listen`, the event to listen for, needs to be a "keyword" that matches a [known event](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html#supported-events) like FIXME "onClick". Keywords are symbolic identifiers that we use in our programs to represent something. They always start with a colon, like `:i-am-a-keyword`, and they‚Äôre a great data type to use for cross-referencing things. We‚Äôll make a listener called `light-switch` that will listen for the `:click` event.

;; This part is cool enough that we should define a fresh toggle cell so you can see them side-by-side. We‚Äôll call the new one `switch`, and the cell that depends on it `click-me`:

(defcell switch false)

(defcell click-me
  (listen :click
          (fn [] (swap! switch not))
          (if @switch
            (circle 40)
            (square 80))))

;; Here's the magic: go ahead and click on the shape `click-me` draws. Then look at the value of `switch`. Now click again. They're connected! Let's dive into how it works. There's a bunch going on.

;; Notice the second argument to `click-me` is an anonymous function with no arguments. (If you want some extra practice, take a minute and change this line from the `(fn [] ...)` style to the `#(...)` style for writing anonymous functions.)

;; This function argument uses a function we haven‚Äôt seen before: `swap!`. The `swap!` function is how we update the value of a cell from outside its original definition. (If you‚Äôve worked with Clojure atoms, it‚Äôs the same thing here. Cells aren‚Äôt atoms but they work the same in this respect.) The oh-so-energetic exclamation point is a warning. Normally, functions are very direct: you give them something, they give you something back, that‚Äôs it. The only thing that happens is you get a return value based on the function you called and the arguments you called it with. Everything happens in plain sight.

;; But functions with exclamation points‚Äìthey break that pattern. They‚Äôre not so simple. The exclamation point is a warning from whoever wrote the function that you call it with arguments, and you don‚Äôt just get a return value, *something changes somewhere else*. üò± These are called "side effects". Programs get harder to think about with side effects. When something happens in a program with side effects, you‚Äôll have to ask, "How did this value get this way?", or "What changed? Where?", and it can be hard to track down the answer. Side effects are powerful, but they require great care, and they should be used only when absolutely necessary. I entrust you now with their power.

;; In this case, the side effect is that we‚Äôre changing the cell‚Äôs value. Each cell has a value, and when another cell needs to change that value, `swap!` is how they do it. (There‚Äôs no such thing as using `def` to name the same thing twice, which might seem like the alternative. We don‚Äôt do that in Clojure.) The `swap!` function takes a cell name and a function, and instead of merely returning something based on those values, it reaches over into the named cell, gets its value, applies the given function to that value, and does two things with the result: sets the value of the cell to that, and returns the new value too.

;; Try playing with `swap!` a bit. You can evaluate it in place to see it change `switch`. What would happen if you use a function other than `not` to change its value?

;; Now, we have cells that aren't just connected to each other, but that we can click and change whenever we want. üëçüèº

;; ## ...and Beyond!

;; There‚Äôs a lot that can be done with cells, and we‚Äôre a little pressed for time here. For more amazing demonstrations of what cells can do, I highly recommend playing around with the demonstration functions in the [Gallery](/gallery).
